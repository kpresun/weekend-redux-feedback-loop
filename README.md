# Prime Academy Feedback Project

## Description

Duration: 2 days

This project helps users input how they feel regarding their class experience. User can input their choices on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is 'terrible and 5 is 'great'.
With this project we are able to solve 3 main things in a simple form:

- Users can go back and forth editing their choices.
- Users cannot proceed without choosing an input.
- Users can do a final review before submitting their feedbacks.

## Installation

1)Create a database with sql commands in data.sql
2) NPM install
3) NPM run server
4) NPM run client
5) Install dependencies with NPM:
    - react
    - react-redux
    - react-dom
    - react-router

## Usage

1) Users start at the beginning of the form and choose their options
2) Users at the end can review their feedback before submitting. They can also start over if they choose to do so.
3) User can start a new feedback if feedback is successfully submitted.
